# tensorflowPartitioningAndScheduling
Simulation of TensorFlow partitioning and scheduling strategies as discribed in [1].

The simulation code including the implementation of the partitioning and scheduling strategies described in [1] are contained in the folder "./Code". 

"./Sample_Data" contains the evaluated networks ("./Sample_Data/Graph") and some examples of setups for the device properties ("./Sample_Data/Device").
